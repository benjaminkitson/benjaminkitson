Hi there, I'm Benjamin, a full-stack developer based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

I specialise in React and Node.js full-stack applications, and am passionate about transparency in tech, software that works for everyone and empowers its users, and making code as uncomplicated as possible.

I currently work as a full-stack Software Engineer at Aviva Zero: https://zero.aviva.co.uk/

When I'm not programming, I'm probably either trying to get AI to do it for me, writing and recording progressive metal music, or trying to make a halfway decent vegan meal.

Always keen to collaborate on projects where possible - get in touch at: benjaminkitson13@gmail.com!
