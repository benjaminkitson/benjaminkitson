Hi there, I'm Benjamin, a full-stack developer based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

I specialise in React and Node.js full-stack applications, and am passionate about transparency in tech, software that works for everyone and empowers its users, making code as uncomplicated as possible, and just generally trying my absolute best to get things done. If theres one thing I enjoy with respect to programming than writing code, it's deleting it where it's superfluous to requirements.

I currently work as a full-stack Software Engineer at Penfold: https://getpenfold.com/

When I'm not programming, I'm probably either trying to get better at bouldering, writing and recording progressive metal music, or trying to make a halfway decent vegan meal.

Always keen to collaborate on projects where possible - get in touch at: benjaminkitson13@gmail.com!
